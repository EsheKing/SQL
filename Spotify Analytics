# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE [BIT.DB_Spotifydata] (
    id               INTEGER        PRIMARY KEY
                                    NOT NULL,

    popularity       INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    danceability     DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    energy           DECIMAL (4, 3) NOT NULL,
    [key]            INTEGER        NOT NULL,

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data.csv into the table.

# Next I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First I determined who are the Top 10 Artists by popularity.
SELECT popularity,artist_name,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Then I determined the Top 5 Artists by tempo greater than 0.00 and energy greater than 0.69 ordered by highest to lowest.
SELECT artist_name,track_name,tempo,energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo > '0.00'AND energy > '0.69'
ORDER BY energy AND tempo DESC
LIMIT 5;
